## About the project

The project has experienced 2 stages, the first one can only be used by single user and has limited functions, and the current one can be used by multiple users with Practice & Challenge Mode.

Practice Mode is for you to memorize new words, while Challenge Mode is for you to test whether you memorized them.  
There are multiple settings for you to decide how you will memorize new words.

You can import and export the wordlist in the format of .xlsx table files, it's so easy and simple!

New users can only be invited by old users to prevent abuse, so they must enter an invitation code when registering. (You can allow any user to register by modifying the code)  
All users have their rights to download their data stored on the server or delete their account and wipe their data permanently.

I'm hosting it on my own server and you can press [this link](https://word.charles14.xyz/) to get there.
