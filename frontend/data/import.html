<title>Word Memo - Import Data</title>
<h1>Import Data - <a href='/'>Go back to homepage</a></h1>
<br>
<p>You can upload a new word list here, the file must be a .xlsx table.</p>
<p>The columns must contain 'Word','Translation'. (It can also contain other columns but Word and Translation are required)</p>
<p>'Status' is an optional column. If you set it, the script will decide the status of the word.</p>
<br>
<p>There are three types of upload you can choose: Append, Overwrite and Clear & Overwrite</p>
<p>If you choose Append, the uploaded words will be appended to existing database. Duplicate words may exist and you will be warned.</p>
<p>If you choose Overwrite, when duplicated words are found, they will be replaced by uploaded ones. Other words will be appended to existing database.</p>
<p>If you choose Clear & Overwrite, all the existing words will be deleted and only the uploaded ones will be kept.</p>
<p>Please note that if you search for a word which is duplicated, only the first-imported one will be shown.</p>
<br>
<p>And, by the way, Excel doesn't support multiple lines in one cell, so if you want to write word / translation with multiple lines, use \n as line break.</p>
